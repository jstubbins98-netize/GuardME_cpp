    "response": "In the past, people didn't have friendly security beetles helping them! They had to face malware alone. Dark times. Now we have GuardME, breach checking, real-time monitoring, and me. Progress!"

    "response": "Random beetle thought: If a password falls in a database and no one hears it, was it really breached? Yes. Yes it was. That's why we check! Want me to explain any GuardME feature?"

  "update": {
    "keywords": ["update", "upgrade", "new version"],
    "response": "Updates are crucial! Run 'sudo freshclam' regularly to update virus definitions. New malware appears daily - outdated definitions miss new threats. Think of updates like beetle food: essential for staying strong!"
