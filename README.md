How it works (k-anonymity):

1. Your password is hashed locally using SHA-1  
2. Only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to the API  
3. The API returns all breached hashes starting with those characters  
4. Your full hash is checked locally against the results  
5. Your actual password NEVER leaves your computer

How to use (Console):

1. Select option 2 "Check password breach status" from the menu  
2. Enter the password you want to check  
3. See if it has been found in any breaches and how many times

How to use (GUI):

1. Go to the Tools tab  
2. Enter your password in the "Password Breach Check" section  
3. Click "Check" to see breach results

Note: This feature is completely free and requires no API key.

Generates secure random 8-character passwords that you can copy to your clipboard.  
Password composition:

* Uppercase letters (A-Z)  
* Lowercase letters (a-z)  
* Numbers (0-9)  
* Special characters (\!@\#$%^&\*)

Console usage:

1. Select option 9 from the main menu  
2. A random password will be displayed in green  
3. Copy it using your terminal's copy shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+C or similar)

GUI usage:

### **Virus Scanner**

Scans files and folders for viruses and malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine with automatic threat quarantine.  
What it does:

* Scans individual files or entire directories  
* Recursively checks all files in folders  
* Identifies specific malware names when threats are found  
* Automatically quarantines detected threats (see below)  
* Reports clean files as safe

How to use (Console):

1. Select option 3 "Scan file/folder for viruses" from the menu  
2. Enter the path to a file or folder  
3. View scan results showing detected threats and quarantine actions

How to use (GUI):

1. Go to the Tools tab  
2. Click "Browse Files" to select a specific file, or "Browse Folders" to select an entire directory  
3. Click "Start Scan" to run the antivirus check  
4. Results show detected threats and any quarantine actions taken

Requirements:

* ClamAV must be installed (clamscancommand available)  
* Run sudo freshclam weekly to update virus definitions (GuardME will remind you)

Automatic Quarantine:  
When a threat is detected, GuardME takes immediate protective action:

1. Strips executable permissions \- Removes execute permissions from the infected file so it cannot be run  
2. Moves to quarantine \- Relocates the file to a secure quarantine directory  
3. Renames with timestamp \- Files are renamed with format: timestamp\_filename.quarantine

| Setting | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Quarantine location | /tmp/guardme\_quarantine/ |
| Directory permissions | 700 (owner only) |
| File naming | 1735441234\_malware.exe.quarantine |

Example output:  
\--- Scan Results \---  
Files Scanned: 5  
Threats Found: 1  
Threats Detected:  
 /path/to/malware.exe: Win.Trojan.Agent FOUND  
Quarantined Files:  
 \-\> /tmp/guardme\_quarantine/1735441234\_malware.exe.quarantine  
Action Taken:  
 \- Executable permissions removed  
 \- Files moved to quarantine: /tmp/guardme\_quarantine  
Weekly Update Reminders:  
GuardME tracks when ClamAV definitions were last updated and reminds you weekly to run freshclam. This ensures your virus definitions stay current for maximum protection.

3. CPU and memory usage update in real-time

---

### **File Threat Assessment**

Analyzes individual files for suspicious characteristics without requiring virus signatures.  
What it checks:

* File entropy: Measures randomness in file content. Very high entropy (above 7.5/8.0) can indicate encrypted or packed malware  
* File extension: Flags dangerous extensions like .exe, .dll, .bat, .cmd, .ps1, .vbs, .js, .scr  
* Overall threat level: Combines factors into Low/Medium/High assessment

How to use (Console):

1. Select option 5 "Assess file threat level" from the menu  
2. Enter the path to the file  
3. View entropy score and threat assessment

How to use (GUI):

Connects to your email via IMAP to scan for phishing attempts, suspicious links, and security threats.  
Wizard-Guided Setup: The email protection feature includes a step-by-step setup wizard:

Step 1: Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, or custom IMAP)

Step 2: Enter your email address and app password

Step 3: Automatic connection and email fetching

Test Connection Feature: Before saving your credentials, you can test if they work:

* Click "Test Connection" to verify your credentials without saving them  
* If the test succeeds, you'll be prompted to connect and save  
* If the test fails, you can adjust your credentials and try again  
* Use "Connect & Save" to connect and save credentials in one step

Supported Providers:

| Provider | IMAP Server | Port |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gmail | imap.gmail.com | 993 |
| Outlook/Hotmail | imap-mail.outlook.com | 993 |
| Yahoo Mail | imap.mail.yahoo.com | 993 |
| iCloud | imap.mail.me.com | 993 |
| Custom | User-defined | User-defined |

Security Analysis: Each email is analyzed for:

* Sender Verification: Checks if display name matches email address  
* Suspicious Links: Detects links to known malicious TLDs or IP-based URLs  
* Phishing Indicators: Scans for urgent/threatening language patterns  
* Attachment Warnings: Alerts when emails contain attachments

Spam Scoring:

* Yahoo: Account Info -> Account Security -> Generate app password

### **Secure Credential Storage (GUI)**

Available in GUI version only  
GuardME includes encrypted credential storage so you don't have to re-enter your email password each time.

| Feature | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Encryption | AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2 key derivation |
| Key Iterations | 100,000 (OWASP recommended) |
| Master Password | Required to unlock your saved credentials |
| Storage Location | \~/.guardme/credentials.vault |

How it works:

1. First-time setup: When you first open Email Protection, you'll be prompted to create a master password  
2. Unlocking the vault: On subsequent visits, enter your master password to unlock saved credentials  
3. Automatic credential saving: After a successful email connection, your credentials are encrypted and saved (if enabled)  
4. Forget credentials: Click "Forget Saved Credentials" anytime to permanently delete stored login info

Forgot Master Password: If you forget your master password, you can reset it by verifying your email credentials:

1. Click "Forgot Master Password?" on the vault page  
2. Enter your email address and email password (the same credentials you originally saved)  
3. Select your email provider  
4. GuardME will connect to your email server to verify you own the account  
5. If verification succeeds, you'll be prompted to create a new master password  
6. Your credentials are re-saved with the new master password

Security notes:

* Your master password is never stored \- only a verification hash is saved  
* Credentials are only saved after a successful connection (invalid passwords aren't stored)  
* Custom IMAP server and port settings are preserved  
* If the vault is locked when you try to save, you'll receive a warning  
* Password reset requires proving ownership via successful email connection

---

## **So what's the difference?**  
As mentioned earlier there are two versions of GuardME: a console and a GUI version. But the two versions are slightly different in terms of functionality, where they can be run and how they operate. Here's the difference:   
Console Version
* **Interface:** Text-based menu in the terminal  
* **Works in:** Any environment (cloud, SSH, servers, headless systems)  
* **Dependencies:** Just libcurl and OpenSSL  
* **File:** Single `console_main.cpp` (\~1,500 lines)

**Features:**

* URL threat analysis  
* Password breach checking  
* Password generator  
* Virus scanning with ClamAV  
* System health monitoring  
* File threat assessment  
* Chat with Guardi (text only)  
* Download folder monitoring

---

GUI Version

* **Interface:** Graphical window with tabs, buttons, and widgets  
* **Works in:** Desktop systems with a display and OpenGL  
* **Dependencies:** Qt6, libcurl, OpenSSL, nlohmann-json, espeak (optional)  
* **Files:** Multiple source files across gui/, core/, security/, network/, utils/ directories

**Everything in Console, plus:**

* Visual dashboard with security statistics  
* WHOIS domain lookup  
* Email Protection with IMAP integration  
* Encrypted credential vault with master password  
* Guardi with cartoon expressions (happy/distressed images)  
* Text-to-speech for Guardi responses  
* Application icon and desktop launcher  
* Scrollable tabs and modern UI

---

Quick Comparison

| Feature | Console | GUI |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| URL Analysis | Yes | Yes |
| Password Breach Check | Yes | Yes |
| Password Generator | Yes | Yes \+ Clipboard Copy |
| Virus Scanning | Yes | Yes |
| System Health | Yes | Yes \+ Visual Dashboard |
| Guardi Chatbot | Text only | Images \+ TTS |
| Email Protection | No | Yes |
| Credential Vault | No | Yes |
| WHOIS Lookup | No | Yes |
| Works in Cloud | Yes | No |

Recommendation  
We recommend the GUI version for the following two reasons:

1. It is easier to operate   
2. There are more features available then there are in the console version simply because they arenât possible in the console version.

Note: While the GUI version is great it does have some flaws. First it requires a system with OpenGL support (I.e. a desktop environment). Another flaw is that there is currently no Microsoft Windows support meaning there is no way to install the GUI version of the program on Microsoft Windows although it is possible to install the console version on Microsoft Windows using WSL.
